# Workshops 

[TABLEAUX 2023](https://www.tableaux2023.org) will host the following co-located workshop.

## Symposium on Proof-theoretic Semantics (P-tS)

* organized by Alexander V. Gheorghiu, Tao Gu, and David J. Pym

The workshop concerns both published and on-going research on any area of P-tS, ranging from foundational studies and applications in any field. It welcomes both presentations of results and informal discussion such as examining open question, reflections on existing work, and presentations of negative results. The following is a rough list of topics relevant to the workshop:

* The P-tS of various logics; for example, classical and intuitionistic logic, susbtructural logics, and modal logics 
* Connexions between P-tS and Computational Logic; for example, Logic Programming
* Connexions between P-tS and other semantics; for example, BHK interpretations and realizability, model-theoretic semantics, and game-theoretic semantics
* Connexions between P-tS and Category Theory 
* Inferentialism in the wider context of applied logic
