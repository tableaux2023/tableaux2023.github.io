# Workshops 

[TABLEAUX 2023](https://www.tableaux2023.org) will host the following co-located workshops.

## Symposium on Proof-theoretic Semantics (P-tS)

* organized by Alexander V. Gheorghiu, Tao Gu, and David J. Pym
* see the [P-tS web page](https://sites.google.com/view/pts-symposium-uk/home) for more information.

> The workshop concerns both published and on-going research on any area of P-tS, ranging from foundational studies and applications in any field. It welcomes both presentations of results and informal discussion such as examining open question, reflections on existing work, and presentations of negative results. The following is a rough list of topics relevant to the workshop:
> 
> * The P-tS of various logics; for example, classical and intuitionistic logic, susbtructural logics, and modal logics 
> * Connexions between P-tS and Computational Logic; for example, Logic Programming
> * Connexions between P-tS and other semantics; for example, BHK interpretations and realizability, model-theoretic semantics, and game-theoretic semantics
> * Connexions between P-tS and Category Theory 
> * Inferentialism in the wider context of applied logic 

## Automated Reasoning with Connection Calculi (AReCCa)

* organized by Jens Otten and Wolfgang Bibel
* see the [AReCCa web page](http://leancop.de/AReCCa-2023/) for more information.

> The main goal of the AReCCa workshop is to foster the development of
> efficient connection calculi and automated theorem proving systems for all
> sorts of classical and non-classical logics. To this end, the AReCCa workshop
> provides a forum to bring together researchers that are interested in
> automated reasoning with connection calculi, in order to present, discuss and
> publish recent developments in this research area.
