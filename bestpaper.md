## Best Paper Awards

The program committee will select

* the TABLEAUX 2023 Best Paper; and,
* the TABLEAUX 2023 Best Junior Researcher Paper.

Researchers will be considered "junior" if either they are students or their PhD degree date is less than two years from the first day of the meeting. For a submission to be eligible for the Best Junior Researcher Paper award, more than 50% of the contribution must be made by the junior researcher(s). The two awards will be presented at the conference.
